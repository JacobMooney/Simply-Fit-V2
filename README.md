# Simply Fit - Fitness for Anyone

Simply Fit is a react class based web site/app. My primary goal during this project was getting used to React and handling the state. This site uses React, React Router, and custom css.

The idea behind the site is that a complete beginner could visit and find all the information needed to start working out efficiently from the start. Information on the site covers basic nutrition information, training methods for various goals, and a routine builder for viewing example routines based on various criteria.
